## A Useful Tip for iPad Multitasking

You may choose to use in-app browser, or not. It would be convenient to see the search result on Safari when you are using Safari searching from Search Center as a secondary app, and see the result on in-app browser when you are using Search Center as a primary app. It is a pain changing the option every time.

In this case, you double tap on search icons. If you set the option to use in-app browser, the search result will be open on Safari when you double tap search icons.
